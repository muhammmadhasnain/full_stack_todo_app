- Success metrics and measurable outcomes
- Scope definition with in/out of scope items

### 2. Architecture Plan (plan.md)
- Technology stack decisions and rationale
- Component API design patterns
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, reliability)
- Risk analysis and mitigation strategies

### 3. Data Model (data-model.md)
- Component data structures (TaskCard, Theme, Animation)
- Configuration models for theming and responsiveness
- User preference models
- Validation rules and relationships

### 4. Quickstart Guide (quickstart.md)
- Development setup instructions
- Component usage examples
- Styling and responsive design guidelines
- Testing and deployment workflows

### 5. Research Document (research.md)

- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) research
- Performance optimization strategies

### 6. Implementation Tasks (tasks.md)
- Phase-based task breakdown (Foundation, Core Components, Advanced Features, etc.)
- Dependencies mapping and risk mitigation
- Acceptance criteria for each task
- Definition of done for quality assurance

### 7. Implementation Checklist (checklists/ui-implementation-checklist.md)
- Comprehensive checklist for UI implementation
- Design system, responsive, and accessibility requirements
- Performance and cross-browser compatibility items
- Testing and validation requirements

### 8. Component Contracts (contracts/ui-component-contracts.md)
- Detailed API contracts for all UI components
- Behavior contracts and success/error paths
- Accessibility and animation contracts
- Testing contracts and performance requirements

## Key Design Principles

### Visual Design

- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Accessible to users with disabilities

### Technical Implementation
- Component-based architecture with reusability
- Performance-optimized animations and interactions
- Accessibility-first approach with WCAG compliance
- Cross-browser compatibility and graceful degradation

## Success Metrics
- Lighthouse accessibility score > 95%
- Core Web Vitals performance targets met
- Responsive design across 5+ screen sizes
- 60fps animations on target devices
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance achieved

## Next Steps
1. Review specifications with stakeholders
2. Begin implementation following the task breakdown
3. Conduct regular accessibility and performance audits
4. Perform user acceptance testing
5. Deploy with feature flags for gradual rollout
