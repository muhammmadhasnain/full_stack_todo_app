## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Performed comprehensive analysis of spec, plan, and tasks files, identifying 10 issues including critical constitution alignment problems.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Identified critical constitution violation requiring spec-driven verification in setup tasks
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md analyzed for consistency
- 🔁 Next prompts: Address critical issues before implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Early analysis prevents costly rework during implementation phase

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
